## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Roktim Taye, a BCA Computer Science student from Dibrugarh, Assam, passionate about building *clean, scalable, and efficient backend systems*.  
I started my journey in the medical field, but discovered my passion for *logic, systems, and problem-solving*, which led me into tech.  

Currently, I’m:
- Sharpening my skills in *Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, Microservices*
- Exploring *AI/ML fundamentals* to integrate intelligent features into backend workflows
- Part of a *specialized program at TIHAN, IIT Hyderabad* for hands-on learning

> I believe in learning by building — understanding concepts deeply, then applying them in real projects.
