### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a dedicated backend developer and BCA student with a unique journey — I shifted from a medical background to tech because I discovered my true passion lies in *logic, systems, and problem-solving*.

Since then, I’ve committed myself to deep, structured learning — not just passing exams, but truly *understanding how systems work and building them* from scratch.
